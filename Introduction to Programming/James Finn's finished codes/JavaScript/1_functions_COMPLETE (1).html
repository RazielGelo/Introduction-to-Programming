        <h1>JavaScript Functions 1</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><em>Hello World</em>
            <br/>
            Create a simple function that console.logs "Hello World". Without using a loop, invoke/call this function 3 times.
            </li>
            <script>
                function hello() {
                    console.log("Hello World");
                }
                hello();
                hello();
                hello();
                
            </script>


            <li><em>Goodnight World</em>
            <br/>
            Create a simple function that console.logs "Goodnight World". This time use a for loop to <em>call</em> the function ten times. Do not put the loop inside the function.
            </li>
            <script>
                function goodnight() {
                    console.log("Goodnight World");
                }
                for (let i=0; i<10; i+=1) {
                    goodnight();
                }
            </script>


            <li><em>Name and Address</em>
            <br/>
            Create 2 functions: one that creates a console.log saying "My name is ..." and the other a console.log that says "I live in ...". Call both of these functions with the name function happening first.
            </li>
            <script>
                function name() {
                    console.log("My name is James");
                }
                function address() {
                    console.log("I live in Vancouver");
                }

                name();
                address();
            </script>


            <li><em>Name and Address Called Differently</em>
            <br/>
            Do the same again however this time call the address function inside the name function and do it in such a way that the address log comes first. Remember you can call a function inside of another function.
            </li>
            <script>
                function name2() {
                    address2();
                    console.log("My name is James");
                }
                function address2() {
                    console.log("I live in Vancouver");
                }
            </script>


            <li><em>Choose Which Function to Call</em>
            <br/>
            Create 2 functions:<br>one that logs "My favourite fruit is ..." and then logs "It is grown in ...".<br>The second function should log "My favourite music is ..." and then logs "... plays this kind of music".<br><br>Then use a confirm box to only call one of these functions (Fruit or Music) based on the user's reaction e.g. ("OK = fruit, Cancel = music").
            </li>
            <script>
                function fruit() {
                    console.log("My favourite fruit is grapes");
                    console.log("They are grown in France");
                }
                function music() {
                    console.log("My favourite music is rock");
                    console.log("RHCP plays this kind of music");
                }

                const selection = confirm("Music or Fruit");
                if (selection) {
                    music();
                }
                else {
                    fruit();
                }
            </script>


            <li><em>Name Analysis</em>
            <br/>
            Create a single function that does the following. Ask the user to type their name into a prompt. Then ask the user how old they are using a prompt. Check to see how many characters are in the name. If the name has more than 10 characters consider the name as being long. In a single console.log print the following message<br><br>
            "Hello X how are you today?<br>
            You have a long/short name which has X characters<br>
            You are X years old and so were born in the year XXXX"<br><br>
            Call this function once.
            </li>
            <script>
                function nameAnalysis() {
                    const name = prompt("Name");
                    const age = parseInt(prompt("What is your age?"));
                    const nameLength = name.length;
                    const nameSize = (nameLength < 10) ? "small" : "long";

                    console.log(`Hello ${name} how are you today?
                        You have a ${nameSize} name which has ${nameLength} characters.
                        You are ${age} years old and so were born in the year ${2021 - age}`)
                }
            </script>
        </ol>

        <script>

        </script>
