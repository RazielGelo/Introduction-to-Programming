        <br>
        <em>20%</em> of the marks will go to how well you comment your code. This also incorporates good naming
        conventions for variables & <strong>proper formatting/organisation of your code</strong>.
        <br>
        <em>20%</em> of the marks will go to how efficient your code is using the methods you have learned up to this

        <li><em>Student Test Results</em>
            <br>
            The test results of six different students are presented below. Each student has gotten a number score
            ranging between 0 and 100 from 5 of their most recent tests.
            <br>
            Student 1: 70.5, 88.0, 91.0, 85.5, 66.5
            <br>
            Student 2: 90.5, 92.5, 90.0, 95.0, 87.5
            <br>
            Student 3: 75.5, 75.0, 77.0, 75.5, 81.5
            <br>
            Student 4: 55.5, 68.0, 71.5, 85.0, 66.0
            <br>
            Student 5: 70.5, 88.0, 91.0, 85.5, 66.5
            <br>
            Student 6: 80.5, 87.0, 57.0, 75.5, 64.0
            <br>
            <br>
            Arrange the data in a suitable format. Write code that prints a console.log for each student that states
            "Student X has an average score of Y" where X is the student number and Y is the average or mean of the
            students' test results fixed to 2 decimal points. After this, print a single console.log that says "Student
            X has gotten a score of less than 60% => Z" where Z is the score that is below 60. Only do this if the
            student has gotten a test result below 60.
